      <h3 id="headline"> Little description of what is a Vagabond </h2>
      
      <li> 1. Wandering from place to place without any settled home; nomadic.

        <li>2. Leading an unsettled or carefree life.
          
          
         <li><strong> 2010 to 2017</strong> - I lived as a traveling digital nomad & expat — visiting over 50 countries while “vagabonding” around the world from place to place.
      <li><strong>Anna Everywhere </strong> -I recently decided to move back to the United States and married her. And I still spend about 6 months a year travelling. </ul>
        <ul>
        <h3 id="headlines">The reason why to travel so long</h3>
        
      <li><strong>Travel doesn't have to be expensive.</strong>
      <li><strong>Adventure is worthwhile.</strong>
      <li><strong>The world isn't as dangerous as you think</strong>
    </ul>
